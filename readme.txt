= How do I display multiple featured images in a theme that doesn't natively support this plugin? =

4bzCore provides a function to retrieve the post meta data, which includes the featured images, video/audio embed, and the related posts ids. Here is the suggested code to use: 
	
	global $fourbzcore_plugin;
	if ( isset( $fourbzcore_plugin ) && method_exists( $fourbzcore_plugin, 'get_post_meta' ) ) {
		$your_variable = $fourbzcore_plugin->get_post_meta( $post_id /* optional */ );
	}

Here is the structure of the array:

array( 
	// featured images.
	'media' => array(
		array (
			'url' => string,
			'alt_text' => string,
			'width'	=> int,
			'height' => int,
		)
	),
	// video/audio iframe embed code.
	'media_embed' => array (
		'code' => string,
	),
	// related posts ids.
	'related' => string,
)

Note that the default wordpress featured image is not included in this array. You have to retrieve this through wordpress functions, such as get_the_post_thumbnail.
		
= How do I display the extra user profile fields in a theme that doesn't natively support this plugin? =

4bzCore provides a function to retrieve the user meta data, which includes the user avatar, title,  address, phone number, social share links, and skills. Here is the suggested code to use: 
	global $fourbzcore_plugin;
	if ( isset( $fourbzcore_plugin ) && method_exists( $fourbzcore_plugin, 'get_user_meta' ) ) {
		$your_variable = $fourbzcore_plugin->get_user_meta( $user_id /* optional */ );
	}

Here is the structure of the array:

array( 
	// Title
	'title' => string,
	// Contact info 
	'contact_address'	=>	string,
	'contact_phone'	=>	string,
	'contact_facebook'	=>	string,
	'contact_twitter'	=>	string,
	'contact_google'	=>	string,
	'contact_linkedin'	=>	string,
	'contact_instagram'	=>	string,
	'contact_tumblr'	=>	string,
	'contact_pinterest'	=>	string,
	// Skills
	'items'				=>	array,
	// Avatar
	'avatar'			=>	string,
	'avatar_width'		=>	int,
	'avatar_height'		=>	int,
	'avatar_alt'		=>	string,
)

= The featured posts shortcode/widget displays all of my posts, why? =

This shortcode/widget displays sticky posts, and if there are no sticky posts to display, it defaults to display recent posts. So, if there is no limit set and there are no sticky posts, then this shortcode/widget will display all posts. This is not a bug, but the default behaviour.
